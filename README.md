# Upsilon | Real Estate
Upsilon is a real estate frontend only website design allowing the viewer to learn more about the company alongside the houses and apartments that are available in various sizes, prices, & locations. 

The project was created for the purpose of improving my skills in UI & UX design, layout, aesthetic, and practicality. Creating the Upsilon allowed me to enjoy the process of design, from the images & layout used, to the ease and enjoyment the end user has while navigating througout the website.
